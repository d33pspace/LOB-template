Thank you! Your support provided a hot holiday meal to 100 homeless guests 
and introduced them to our job training program. And because family reunions 
such a big tradition at this time of year, your gifts help overcome the 
sadness of having no family or being unable or afraid to return home. 
<b>Your kindness also gave a few renminbi in a traditional red envelope to 
guests who could not otherwise afford their next meal because there's no 
short-term work over the holiday.</b>

It brought me hope."

He was incredibly grateful for the gift of cash. 
"I don't know what I would have done without your hongbao." Better yet, 
Chen has already started our job training program. <u>He is enthusiastically 
doing daily chores and learning to read and write, practicing his characters 
in a notebook used by schoolchildren.</u>
<br/><br/>Our Spring Festival meal includes traditional dumplings, or jiaozi, all 
handmade by volunteers. </span><b>Because we serve meals every day, can you help 
provide more essential food this spring? It will definitely attract more 
people into our training program.</b>

Were you ever given a second chance in life? What about a third chance? Each one of us has experienced failure at some point, but then there's the kind of personal crisis that happens right on the verge of success...
<br/><br/>Luo Yu could tell you all about it. He was doing exceptionally well in our residential program and ready to start training one day a week at one of our outstanding partner restaurants, M on the Bund - when he suddenly disappeared. 
<br/><br/>That was a year ago. It was sad but understandable - because we know that even small steps toward full-time employment can be intimidating for those who know the joy of total freedom, even if it comes with the pain of homelessness. 
<br/><br/>But ... now Luo Yu is back! And far from getting the cold shoulder from 
his former friends, we're still ready to help him make a new start. 
Every part of our journey brings us to where we are, and for Luo Yu, 
it's your support that says, "Yes, come back, you wanderer!" 
<br/><br/>Like anyone who succeeds in our very challenging program, Luo Yu is an extremely
</span></div></div>

<span>
hard worker who is once again learning to apply his effort do doing tasks according to plan, not just the way he thinks best. And he says he's ready this time to finish the work he started, "I just want a stable, well-paid job. I've been drifting for too long." 
<br/><br/>The Renewal Center's training program is often the key to successful 
life-change, and is open to anyone who is willing to put in serious work 
towards finding full-time employment. </span><b>We spend XXX RMB per person, 
per day for meals, training and accommodation, including the work our 
trainees do to keep the Renewal Center working for others. Your help 
today could change a life!</b>
